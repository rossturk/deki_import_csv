deki_import_csv
===============

This little script creates a bunch of Deki pages, one for each line in a CSV.  You have to tell it what page to put them under by editing the script, and enter username/password credentials when it prompts you.

If you see references to "RFP" content in there, that's because I wrote it to import a bunch of RFP responses into MindTouch.
